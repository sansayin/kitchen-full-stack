# Intro

In the past four days, I have been working on a project in the restaurant scenario, which involves multiple points of meal order systems at the front and order boards in the kitchen. It's a typical full-stack environment that necessitates a wide range of technologies to ensure smooth and efficient operations.

The project has been a fascinating journey. It's interesting to delve deep into the complexities of such a system. Just like Rome wasn't built in a single night by a single person, I understand that significant projects require time and effort. I'm dedicated to putting in the hard work and going as far as I can with this project. It's a great learning experience, and I'm committed to making steady progress.
